            The United States transitioned from a mid-20th-century &#34;golden age&#34; of worker protections to
            today&#39;s near-universal &#34;at-will&#34; employment regime due to a confluence of factors. These include
            the judicial imposition of at-will employment in the late 19th century, reinforced by Lochner-era Supreme
            Court decisions prioritizing &#34;freedom of contract.&#34; Subsequent legislative retreats, notably the
            Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, weakened unions and codified at-will employment. The exclusion of key worker
            groups from labor laws further fragmented worker power. In the neoliberal era, employer strategies like
            union avoidance and offshoring, coupled with court decisions mandating arbitration and upholding class
            action waivers, significantly eroded collective bargaining and legal recourse, solidifying the at-will
            regime.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The 1930s witnessed a seismic shift in American labor relations, largely driven by the economic
              devastation of the Great Depression and the subsequent legislative agenda of President Franklin D.
              Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal. A cornerstone of this era was the <a
                href="https://workerorganizing.org/wagner-act-national-labor-relations-act-right-to-unionize-6700/"
                class="citation">National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935</a>, more commonly known as the Wagner Act.
              This landmark legislation fundamentally altered the balance of power between employers and employees by
              explicitly guaranteeing private-sector workers the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist
              labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage
              in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid and protection.
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The Wagner Act was a direct response to widespread employer abuses, including spying on, interrogating,
              disciplining, discharging, and blacklisting union members, practices that had been rampant before its
              passage. To enforce these rights, the Act established the <a

                class="citation">National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)</a>, an independent federal agency tasked with
              mediating labor disputes, guaranteeing democratic union elections, and penalizing unfair labor practices
              by employers.

                &#34;However, it is crucial to note that the Wagner Act&#39;s protections were not universal; it
                specifically excluded agricultural laborers, domestic workers, and government employees, a significant
                omission that disproportionately affected African American and female workers and fragmented potential

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The doctrine of <strong>at-will employment</strong>, which allows employers to terminate employees for any
              reason or no reason at all, was <strong>not a product of democratic legislative deliberation but rather a
                judicial invention</strong> that emerged in the late 19th century. Legal scholars widely attribute the
              formal articulation of the at-will rule to <a href="http://www.rbs2.com/atwill.htm"
                class="citation">Horace G. Wood&#39;s 1877 treatise, <em>Master and Servant</em></a>, where he stated
              that &#34;a general or indefinite hiring is prima facie a hiring at will.&#34;

              <p class="text-red-800 italic">
                &#34;Remarkably, subsequent analyses have shown that Wood&#39;s pronouncement was not well-supported by
                the case law he cited, leading many to conclude that he essentially invented the rule and presented it
                as established law.&#34;

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              The entrenchment of the at-will doctrine was significantly influenced by judicial interpretations
              following the passage of the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/13th-amendment"
                class="citation">Thirteenth Amendment in 1865</a>, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.
              Proponents of the at-will rule ingeniously co-opted the Amendment&#39;s guarantee of a <a

                class="citation">&#34;right to quit&#34; for workers</a>, arguing that if workers possessed the
              fundamental right to terminate their employment at will, then a reciprocal &#34;right to fire&#34; at will
              must also exist for employers.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              This argument represented a significant distortion of Congressional intent during Reconstruction, as there
              is no evidence that lawmakers intended the anti-subordination protections of the Thirteenth Amendment to
              confer upon employers an unbridled right to discharge workers without cause. This judicial activism
              effectively embedded a system of employer control that had <strong>racialized dimensions</strong>,
              particularly as employers sought new methods to manage labor, including formerly enslaved Black people and
              immigrant workers, in the post-slavery economy.

              The consequences of these exclusions were far-reaching. By omitting large segments of the workforce, the
              Wagner Act effectively <strong>fragmented the labor movement from its inception</strong>. It created a
              two-tiered system of labor rights, where industrial workers gained significant protections and bargaining
              power, while agricultural and domestic workers were largely left to fend for themselves. This division
              weakened the overall political and economic power of the labor movement, as a united front including these
              sectors could have been a more formidable force.

              While some states recognize limited common law exceptions to at-will employment (e.g., public policy
              exceptions, implied contract exceptions based on employee handbooks), these are often narrowly construed
              by courts and provide far less comprehensive protection than a true &#34;just cause&#34; standard. The
              continued prevalence of at-will employment means that most American workers lack robust job security and
              can be dismissed without the employer needing to demonstrate a legitimate, performance-related reason or
              follow fair procedures.

              robust worker protections and to move away from the at-will employment regime in the United States. This
              doctrine often presumes a <strong>mythical equality of bargaining power</strong> between individual

              dominance and at-will employment was reinforced. The cumulative effect of these failures has been a
              continued erosion of worker protections and a legal framework that lags behind international standards.

              To address the fundamental imbalance in U.S. labor relations and provide meaningful job security,
              <strong>Congress should enact federal legislation establishing a &#34;just cause&#34; standard for all
                employee dismissals</strong>. This would replace the default at-will employment rule, requiring
              employers to demonstrate a legitimate, job-related reason (such as poor performance, misconduct, or
              genuine economic necessity) for terminating an employee, and to follow fair and transparent procedures.

              Concurrently, the <strong>National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) must be significantly strengthened</strong>
              to protect workers&#39; rights to organize and bargain collectively. This includes imposing stricter
              penalties on employers who engage in unfair labor practices (such as firing workers for union activity),
              streamlining the union certification process, facilitating first-contract negotiations, and prohibiting
              the permanent replacement of striking workers. These reforms would help rebuild worker power and ensure
              that collective bargaining can effectively establish fair terms and conditions of employment.

              restrictive laws, can exercise their fundamental labor rights.

              The U.S. should also consider adopting policies like <strong>mandated paid family and sick leave</strong>,
              which are standard in nearly all other OECD nations but absent at the federal level in the U.S.
              Furthermore, exploring models of <strong>sectoral bargaining</strong>, where wages and working conditions
              are negotiated across entire industries rather than just at the enterprise level, could help raise
              standards for all workers and reduce income inequality. International conventions of the International
              Labour Organization (ILO) provide important benchmarks that the U.S. should strive to meet.
